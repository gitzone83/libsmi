libsmi (0.4.8+dfsg2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * MIB that were shipped in libsmi2-common were non-free: most of them
    were licensed under the same license than the corresponding IETF
    RFC. Therefore, libsmi2-common package becomes empty and suggests
    libsnmp-base instead which should propose to download MIB from
    Internet.
