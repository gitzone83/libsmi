Description: A library to access SMI MIB information 
 The purpose of libsmi is to 
   * give network management applications a concise programmer-friendly
     interface to access MIB module information, 
   * separate the knowledge on SMI from the main parts of management 
     applications, 
   * allow to add new kinds of MIB repositories without the need to adapt 
     applications that make use of libsmi. 
 .
 In this context, MIB is "Management Information Base" and SMI stands for
 "Structure and identification of Management Information". See RFC1902 and
 others for details.
